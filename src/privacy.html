                        This cookie cannot be used by anyone other than Google. Googleâ€™s ability to use and share
                        information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our website is restricted by the

                        it was collected, unless a longer retention period is required by law. We take reasonable
                        measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized
                        access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
